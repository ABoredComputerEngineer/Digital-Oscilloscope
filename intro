We are Mossaholics, a team of four Undergraduate Students at Central Campus,
Pulchowk, Nepal currently participating in the Hult Prize 2020. 
We aim to revolutionalize the way air pollution is handled in cities like
Kathmandu through the use of moss.
For this, we have taken part in the Hult Prize 2020 in order to grow and
develop our idea as a growing business. We have made it into the Tokyo Regional Summit.
